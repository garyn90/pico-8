1)Map objects will have a Boolean of collide=true if it checks against the player object.
2)To do so, we need to check the player objects x + w (the x coordinate with its full implied width, or w), and y + h(the PObj's y coordinate and height, or h).
3)The collision function needs to detect even a single sprite clipping into the PObj, and if it does so, we set rules to follow up with collision.
